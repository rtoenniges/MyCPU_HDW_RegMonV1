# MyCPU_HDW_RegMonV1

This little extension is a "live-display" for the register-set of the MyCPU.
The display shows the 16-bit wide address register, the 8-bit wide accumulator, X- and Y-register and stackpointer, and the three flags "overflow", "zero" and "carry".

The display board is layed out as piggyback for the CPU itself. The board is connected to the CPU either with flat cables or (with a bit tinkering) with long wirewrap-connectors. 
Because of this the display board is not suited for rack mount of the MyCPU system.
